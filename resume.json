    "summary": "With over 7 years of professional experience as a Solution Architect and a couple more as Full Stack Developer, I focus on delivering software that solves real business problems — not just what IT thinks might be useful.\n\nAs an architect and lead developer in the banking sector, I’ve successfully transformed existing software monoliths into modular monoliths and microservices. I have also defined and implemented development guidelines, libraries, and standards for entire client organizations, enabling internal teams to adopt consistent, scalable, and future-proof practices.\n\nAs a backend developer, my journey spans from the classic Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) 5/6 with IBM WebSphere 8, through to modern Spring Boot 3 with GitHub Actions and Kubernetes running in Microsoft Azure. My development approach is always grounded in Domain-Driven Design, complemented by Layered or Hexagonal Architecture depending on project complexity.\n\nAs a frontend developer, my experience goes back to PlayFramework 1, Ruby on Rails 3, and early JavaScript libraries like jQuery and Dojo. I have led multiple client projects using IBM Business Automation Workflow 8 (with and without IS Financial) in JavaScript, a small engagement with Angular 2, and many large and small-scale projects with React 16+ and TypeScript.",
