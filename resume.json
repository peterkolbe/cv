    "summary": "With over 7 years of professional experience as a Solution Architect and a couple more as Full Stack Developer, I focus on delivering software that solves real business problems — not just what IT thinks might be useful.\n\nOn the backend side, my journey spans from the classic Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) 5/6 with IBM WebSphere 8, through to modern Spring Boot 3 with GitHub Actions and Kubernetes running in Microsoft Azure. My development approach is always grounded in Domain-Driven Design, complemented by Layered or Hexagonal Architecture depending on project complexity.\n\nOn the frontend, my experience goes back to PlayFramework 1, Ruby on Rails 3, and early JavaScript libraries like jQuery and Dojo. I have led multiple client projects using IBM BPM 8 (with and without IS Financial) in JavaScript, followed by smaller engagements with Angular 2, and later, numerous large and small-scale projects with React 16+ and TypeScript.\n\nAs an architect and lead developer in the banking sector, I’ve successfully transformed existing software monoliths into modular monoliths and microservices. I have also defined and implemented development guidelines, libraries, and standards for entire client organizations, enabling internal teams to adopt consistent, scalable, and future-proof practices.",
